    <p> 
      If you have ever wanted to make authentic Japanese noodle house ramen, this tonkatsu recipe is for you. This everyday meal is great for singles with some cooking experience; it may take longer than the overall time without cooking experience. To save time, I rarely measure each ingredient's amount due to the large number of small measurements in the recipe.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons spicy sesame oil</li>
      <li>2 (1x3-inch) boneless pork chop slices</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon black sesame seeds, divided</li>
      <li>2 leaves fresh basil, chopped, divided</li>
      <li>1 leaf fresh sage, chopped, divided</li>
      <li>1 (3 ounce) package instant ramen noodles (such as Shirakiku®), seasoning packet discarded</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons shredded dried kombu</li>
      <li>1 ¾ tablespoons bonito soup stock (such as Hondashi®)</li>
      <li>1 ¾ tablespoons soy sauce (shoyu)</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon white miso paste with dashi</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Fill a small pot halfway with water. Bring to a boil; add egg and cook in boiling water for 15 minutes. Drain. Run cold water over egg and set aside to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour sesame oil into a large skillet. Lay pork slices in oil. Cover pork with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds, 1/2 of the basil, and 1/2 of the sage. Flip and cover pork with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, remaining 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds, remaining basil, and remaining sage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook pork, covered, over medium-low heat, until evenly browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until second side is browned, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook ramen noodles in boiling water until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander set in the sink; rinse noodles until water runs clear. Return noodles to the pot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir kombu, bonito stock, soy sauce, and miso paste into noodles. Cook, stirring with chopsticks, over medium heat, until miso paste is dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer noodles to a serving bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          Peel and cut egg in half lengthwise. Place egg, pork slices, and fish paste slices over noodles. Garnish with tonkatsu sauce, ginger, green onion, and black pepper.
